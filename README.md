# SPARKLE Training Template

## Installing

```bash
quarto use template spectrum-spark/training
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your piece of training material

## Using

You just need to add a `presenter` and `contributors` and both blocks will appear.

## Format Options

* `presenter-title`: Phrase before the presenter, which appears at the top of the document
* `presenter`: Title of the presenter, which appears at the top of the document
* `contributors-title`: Heading of the contributors section at the end of the document
* `contributors`: List of contributors that will appear in the contributors section. Each person gets their own entry.

## Example

Here is the source code for a minimal sample document: [example.qmd](example.qmd).
